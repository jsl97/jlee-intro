                <p>This is the humble beginnings to my personal page, I am looking forward to developing it more! I have been working as a backend software engineer in the industry for several years now. I primarily reside in the West Coast in Seattle/San Diego.</p>
                <p>Outside of my career like to enjoy my time playing games, watching tv shows, or relaxing with my goldendoodle :)</p>

                <p>I graduated UCSD in 2020 and started working as a backend software engineer at Amazon on the Alexa Smart Vehicles Navigation team; there I worked on improving our main feature "take me to x address" and also on integrating Alexa to the BMW in-cabin experience among many other projects.</p>
                <p>After taking some time for myself to travel, I joined Snap as a backend engineer on the CI-Infra team responsible for internal services that work together to checkout/merge code, create PRs, and build + release artifacts.</p>
                <p>Some positive qualities I'd say for myself is that I am easy-going, open-minded, and diligent; I love learning about and solving technical problems. :)</p>
